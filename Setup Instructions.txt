The working directory for REDFS is your "Documents" folder
Ex.C:\Users\Vikrama\Documents\

Please copy REDFS_Storage_Spaces\Data\WebUIAssets to "Documents\Global" folder

Run the program and connect to http://localhost:8000/config from your browser

This is not a working FS yet, I'm in the process of porting the FS logic from
https://github.com/reddy2004/RedFS-Windows-Filesystem to here.
