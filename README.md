# REDFS_Storage_Spaces
A RedFS version similar to Windows storage spaces, with a file system spread over multiple files with support for multiple volumes with cloning, snapshots, dedupe and RAID. I wanted to port my previous Filesystem to a multidrive Filesystem with protection such as mirroring and RAID. Unfortunately, writing a Filesystem is quite a challenge and is very difficult to impliment a lot of interesting features in a hobby level programme. I wanted to do a take on Windows Storage Spaces which allows an user to aggregate disks into a pool and then create regular windows drives in that pool. Depending on your configuration, you could have data protection such as Mirroring or RAID5 for your drives. In REDFS, its not straight forward to do something like this, but anyway I wanted to come up with a solution.
