Notes

when file is reading a raid group, read all the stripe into memory. Even if one block is written, then dirty
all the dbns, so that it can be writtin out again as a stripe. This also means dedupe should be aware of stripe
logic and make sure that the dbns of any stripe would have the same refcount/childrefcount.

dbns in a stripe can have refcount as 0. Remember, we have wafl style write, so we know for sure that the stripe
is written only once, so there is no problem as long as the blocks are not modified. This will however be an issue
because lets say we have refcounts of [0,2,3,2] for a stripe. We have a block free, this is called a stripe-hole.
The stripe hole can only filled by background scanners, wich we are offline.
** If we have [0,1,0,2], and we allow live writes, then we could have one file writing to block 0 and another file
trying to write to the third block creating race conditions.


is wip.iohistory required to be checked in fast_read and fast_write.?
Can we reset it when we clean the wip.?


Create a 100 log for tServiceThread for WRLoader.cs

In redfscore - grow wip
            //XXX todo : Dont have to write out just allocated L0 since they will be overwritten anyway.
            //Try to write out L1 & L2s instead


            when we write 9MB, the second L1 goes missing.
